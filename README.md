### Hi there, I'm Eleder Andres 👋

**Systems Software Engineer | Linux Kernel & Security Specialist**

I am a software developer based in Urduliz, currently strictly focused on **Unix Kernel Architecture** and **Cybersecurity** at **42 School**. My engineering philosophy revolves around understanding the "black box"—building systems from scratch to master memory management, process scheduling, and hardware interaction.

My goal is to apply rigorous low-level programming standards (C/Asm) to the **Aerospace and Defense sector**, contributing to mission-critical software.
